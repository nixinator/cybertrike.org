Why are you riding a cyber trike and not a bike, motorcycle or car.

We chose to ride a Cybertrike specifically because of its unique design and the message it conveys. A trike is a three-wheeled vehicle that is often associated with stability, safety, and accessibility. By riding a Cybertrike, we hope to emphasize the importance of safety and accessibility in the world of sleep apnea. Many people with sleep apnea struggle to find safe and effective treatments that they can afford. By riding a trike, we are symbolically representing the importance of finding stable, accessible solutions to this serious health issue.

Furthermore, a trike is a slower and more deliberate form of transportation than a bike, motorcycle, or car. This allows us to take our time, experience the journey more fully, and connect with the communities we encounter along the way. It also provides an opportunity to highlight the importance of a good night's sleep and the benefits of slowing down and taking time for ourselves.

Overall, riding a Cybertrike sends a powerful message about the importance of safety, accessibility, and mindfulness when it comes to our health and wellbeing.


Why raise awareness of sleep apena and  why do you want to 'let a friend get you tested'

We want to raise awareness of sleep apnea because it is a serious health condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Sleep apnea is a disorder in which a person's breathing is repeatedly interrupted during sleep, leading to a range of health problems, including fatigue, high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. Unfortunately, many people with sleep apnea go undiagnosed, as they may not be aware of the symptoms or the risks involved.

By raising awareness of sleep apnea, we hope to encourage people to learn more about the condition and get tested if they suspect they may be suffering from it. We believe that early diagnosis and treatment can make a significant difference in the lives of people with sleep apnea, allowing them to get the restful sleep they need and reduce their risk of associated health problems.

We also encourage people to "let a friend get you tested" because often, it can be difficult to recognize the signs of sleep apnea in ourselves. It's not uncommon for people with sleep apnea to be unaware of their condition until a friend or family member notices the symptoms and encourages them to seek help. By looking out for each other and raising awareness of sleep apnea, we can help ensure that more people get the treatment they need to lead healthier, happier lives.

If you have sleep apnea are you fit enough for this epic journey

 While it's certainly possible for people with sleep apnea to experience significant improvements in their symptoms and quality of life with the right treatment, it's important to note that there is no known cure for sleep apnea at this time.

That being said, with the right treatment and ongoing care, many people with sleep apnea are able to effectively manage their condition and enjoy a full and active life. This may involve the use of a CPAP machine, weight loss, and lifestyle changes, as well as regular check-ins with a healthcare provider to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.

The Cybertrike journey is designed to raise awareness of sleep apnea and support those who are living with the condition, whether they are in the process of recovering or simply managing their symptoms. We encourage everyone to prioritize their health and wellbeing and work closely with their healthcare providers to develop a plan that is safe and appropriate for their individual needs. By working together and supporting each other, we can all make a positive impact on the world and achieve our goals.
