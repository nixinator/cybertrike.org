Cyber Trike FAQ.


* What is obstructive sleep apnea

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder that causes a person's breathing to repeatedly stop and start during sleep. It occurs when the muscles in the back of the throat fail to keep the airway open, despite efforts to breathe. This can result in loud snoring, gasping for air, and interrupted sleep. OSA can lead to a range of health problems, including high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and depression, among others. It is important to get a proper diagnosis and treatment for OSA to avoid these serious health consequences.

* Why are you riding a cyber trike and not a bike, motorcycle or car.

We chose to ride a Cybertrike specifically because of its unique design and the message it conveys. A trike is a three-wheeled vehicle that is often associated with stability, safety, and accessibility. By riding a Cybertrike, we hope to emphasize the importance of safety and accessibility in the world of sleep apnea. Many people with sleep apnea struggle to find safe and effective treatments that they can afford. By riding a trike, we are symbolically representing the importance of finding stable, accessible solutions to this serious health issue.

Furthermore, a trike is a slower and more deliberate form of transportation than a bike, motorcycle, or car. This allows us to take our time, experience the journey more fully, and connect with the communities we encounter along the way. It also provides an opportunity to highlight the importance of a good night's sleep and the benefits of slowing down and taking time for ourselves.

Overall, riding a Cybertrike sends a powerful message about the importance of safety, accessibility, and mindfulness when it comes to our health and wellbeing.


* Why raise awareness of sleep apena and  why do you want to 'let a friend get you tested'

We want to raise awareness of sleep apnea because it is a serious health condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Sleep apnea is a disorder in which a person's breathing is repeatedly interrupted during sleep, leading to a range of health problems, including fatigue, high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. Unfortunately, many people with sleep apnea go undiagnosed, as they may not be aware of the symptoms or the risks involved.

By raising awareness of sleep apnea, we hope to encourage people to learn more about the condition and get tested if they suspect they may be suffering from it. We believe that early diagnosis and treatment can make a significant difference in the lives of people with sleep apnea, allowing them to get the restful sleep they need and reduce their risk of associated health problems.

We also encourage people to "let a friend get you tested" because often, it can be difficult to recognize the signs of sleep apnea in ourselves. It's not uncommon for people with sleep apnea to be unaware of their condition until a friend or family member notices the symptoms and encourages them to seek help. By looking out for each other and raising awareness of sleep apnea, we can help ensure that more people get the treatment they need to lead healthier, happier lives.

* If you have sleep apnea are you fit enough for this epic journey

 While it's certainly possible for people with sleep apnea to experience significant improvements in their symptoms and quality of life with the right treatment, it's important to note that there is no known cure for sleep apnea at this time.

That being said, with the right treatment and ongoing care, many people with sleep apnea are able to effectively manage their condition and enjoy a full and active life. This may involve the use of a CPAP machine, weight loss, and lifestyle changes, as well as regular check-ins with a healthcare provider to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.

The Cybertrike journey is designed to raise awareness of sleep apnea and support those who are living with the condition, whether they are in the process of recovering or simply managing their symptoms. We encourage everyone to prioritize their health and wellbeing and work closely with their healthcare providers to develop a plan that is safe and appropriate for their individual needs. By working together and supporting each other, we can all make a positive impact on the world and achieve our goals.

* how can you use a cpap machine while camping off grid

Using a CPAP machine while camping off-grid can present some challenges, as the machine typically requires a steady supply of electricity to operate. However, there are several options available that can make it possible to use a CPAP machine in a camping or off-grid setting.

One option is to use a portable battery pack specifically designed for use with CPAP machines. These battery packs can be charged using a standard outlet or a portable solar panel and can provide several nights' worth of power for the machine, depending on the size and capacity of the battery. Some CPAP machines also have built-in batteries that can be charged and used while off-grid.

Another option is to use a power inverter to convert the DC power from a car or RV battery into the AC power needed to run the CPAP machine. This can be a good option for those who are traveling in a vehicle or have access to a portable power source.

It's also important to consider the physical logistics of using a CPAP machine while camping, such as keeping the machine clean and protected from the elements, and ensuring that there is adequate ventilation and space to set up the machine and mask.

Overall, while using a CPAP machine while camping off-grid may require some extra planning and preparation, it is certainly possible with the right equipment and resources. 

* why is your motto hear it (snoring) , say it (get them tested for sleep apena) , sort it ( diagnosis and possibly using a CPAP treatment) 

he motto "hear it, say something, sort it" is particularly relevant to the issue of sleep apnea, a common and potentially serious sleep disorder that affects many people around the world.

The first step, "hear it," involves recognizing the symptoms of sleep apnea, which can include loud snoring, gasping or choking during sleep, daytime sleepiness, and difficulty concentrating or remembering things. These symptoms may be noticed by the person with sleep apnea themselves, or by their sleeping partner or family members.

The second step, "say it," involves speaking up and encouraging those who may be experiencing sleep apnea to seek out a diagnosis and treatment. This may involve having a conversation with a loved one about their symptoms, suggesting that they speak to their healthcare provider, or sharing information about the risks and potential complications of untreated sleep apnea.

The final step, "sort it," involves taking action to address the sleep apnea and improve the person's quality of life. This may involve a range of treatment options, including the use of a CPAP machine, lifestyle changes such as weight loss or improved sleep hygiene, and other interventions as recommended by a healthcare provider.

By following this motto and taking action to address sleep apnea, we can help to improve the health and wellbeing of ourselves and our loved ones. Sleep apnea is a serious condition that can have significant impacts on physical and mental health, and it's important that we all work together to promote awareness, encourage testing and diagnosis, and support effective treatment options.


* are CPAP machines expensive? , how do less fortunate people afford one.

CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) machines can be expensive, with costs ranging from a few hundred to several thousand dollars, depending on the model and features. In addition to the cost of the machine itself, there may also be ongoing expenses for replacement parts, filters, and accessories.

For those who are less fortunate and cannot afford a CPAP machine, there are various options available to help make these devices more accessible. One option is to seek out financial assistance programs, which may be available through non-profit organizations, government agencies, or private foundations. Some of these programs may offer grants or low-interest loans to help cover the cost of a CPAP machine or other sleep apnea treatments.

Another option is to look into secondhand or refurbished CPAP machines, which may be available at a lower cost. While it's important to ensure that any used CPAP machine is in good working condition and has been properly cleaned and disinfected, this can be a cost-effective option for those on a tight budget.
